Simple Chatbot
Welcome to the Simple Chatbot repository. This project demonstrates how to create a chatbot in Python that uses a text file to answer predefined questions. It's designed as a starting point for those interested in learning about chatbot development.

Overview
The chatbot uses a data.txt file to store pairs of questions and answers, making it straightforward to customize and extend. The core script, chatbot.py, manages user input and outputs the corresponding answers.
